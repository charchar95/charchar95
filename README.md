I am a dynamic programmer dedicated to lifelong learning who thrives in a collaborative work environment. I create applications and sites that are beautiful, impactful, and user-centered. I'm a team player with an expansive toolkit of interpersonal skills and a background in outdoor education. I spearhead my own professional development by studying best practices independently, seeking mentorship from those with more experience, and engaging in constructive feedback loops.
